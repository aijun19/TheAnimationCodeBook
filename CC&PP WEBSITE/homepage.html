          <p>Unfolds through a series of workshops/ one-to-one tutorials. Topics were carefully selected and ordered to progress logically from simple concepts to more advanced ones. Lessons are supported with access to the material, and lesson take-ways, for which students produce thir response to what was taught in class</p>

          <h2>Progress</h2>
          <p>The project is currently finished with its first student testing and is now in the stage of improving the lessons iteratively after lesson feedback. Future steps include having bigger workshops, and lengthening the curriculum. There is a public repository for students to add their responses and work to the class material.</p>
